# Mars Rover APP

With the interest with space exploration increasing, and with our attention focused on Mars,
one of the biggest humanity achievements is the fact of having a robot exploring Mars for us,
more specifically the Curiosity Rover. Using one of the existing NASA APIâ€™s, more specifically the Mars Rover Photos, I made a
frontend app, using React that enables a user to see 6 photos randomly picked from this API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Runs the server.

> In order to run the server, you need in first place, copy the content of `env.tpl` file to a new file named `.env`.

## Available Scripts for client

In the project directory /client, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the client app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles the client app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Then you should be good serving it with an static server like `serve`

```
npm i -g serve
serve -s build
```
