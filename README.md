# Mars Rover APP

With the interest with space exploration increasing, and with our attention focused on Mars,
one of the biggest humanity achievements is the fact of having a robot exploring Mars for us,
more specifically the Curiosity Rover. Using one of the existing NASA API’s, more specifically the Mars Rover Photos, I made a
frontend app, using React that enables a user to see 6 photos randomly picked from this API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Runs the server.

> In order to run the server, you need in first place, copy the content of `env.tpl` file to a new file named `.env`.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
